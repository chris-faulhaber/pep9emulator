# What is Pep/9?

The Pep/9 computer is a 16-bit complex instruction set computer (CISC). It is designed to teach computer architecture, assembly language programming, and computer organization principles as described in the text [_Computer Systems_, J. Stanley Warford, 5th edition](http://computersystemsbook.com/5th-edition/). Pep/9 instructions are based on an expanding opcode and are either unary (one byte) or nonunary (three bytes). The eight addressing modes and eight dot commands are designed for straightforward translation from C to assembly language.

# What is This?
This is a GoLang rewrite based on the textbook (5th Edition) description and definition of the Pep/9 computer. This code is similar too but not based on the code supported by the Author;
